## Process:
This group project was collaborated by Jeffrey Sun, Young Chhay, Kevin Ng & Drum Holliday. The tasks were divded equally amongst all members.
* Jeffrey researched the Yelp API keys and designed the functionality in the JSS.
* Young orchestrated the Github structure, Terminal push/pulls and Math.random functions for the yelp reviews
* Kevin contributed to the framework with the html + basic styling in css as well as the weather API key functionality.
* Drum provided the pictures as well as styling in css & bulma, and also made edits and corrections in the JSS.
  
Although the project seemed overwhelming at first, everyone helped each other and filled in the gaps when needed. Our team work, persistence and communication was what helped our team prevail and design EPS.

* Limited Free API's available for travel searches
* Debugging and fixing code errors
* Merging two HTML pages into one 

## User Story:
* As A Traveler
* I want to see the weather forecast for cities when I search for them so I can plan a trip accordingly
* When I search for a city,
* Then I am presented with current and 5 day weather conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history.
* When the city is loaded,
* Then the Yelp API will load reviews into 3 categories with pictures 
  * Top #1 Rated Restaurant
  * Top #1 Activity
  * Top #1 Hotels to Stay
